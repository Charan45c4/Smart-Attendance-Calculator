# Smart-Attendance-Calculator

Bunker is a smart attendance calculator website. It allows users to dynamically input the total number of classes conducted, classes attended, and their desired minimum attendance percentage. It then calculates how many more classes they can afford to miss or need to attend. Users can also input the number of classes per day for more accurate results tailored to individual schedules.
